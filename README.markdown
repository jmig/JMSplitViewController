JMSplitViewController
=====================

JMSplitViewController is NOT a replacement for UISplitViewController. I made it for my own use but feel free to use/fork it.
This lib is based on MGSplitViewController by @mattgemmell <https://github.com/mattgemmell/MGSplitViewController>
If you're looking for an UISplitViewController replacement with enhancements you should look at Matt's Lib.
